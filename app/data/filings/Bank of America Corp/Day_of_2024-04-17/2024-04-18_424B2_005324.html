of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor, and on the performance of the Underlyings. The economic terms of the Notes are based

on BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and

the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC&rsquo;s affiliates enter into. BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate is typically

lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate,

as well as the underwriting discount, if any, and the hedging related charges described below (see &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; beginning

on page PS-10), will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these factors,

the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the pricing

date.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The initial estimated value range of the Notes is

set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the

Notes as of the pricing date. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the Notes, see &ldquo;Risk

Factors&rdquo; beginning on page PS-10 and &ldquo;Structuring the Notes&rdquo; on page PS-28.</P>

risks, many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security. Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after

carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular

circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes

or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the &ldquo;Risk

Factors&rdquo; sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as identified on page PS-33 below. </I></P>

of any Underlying exceeds its Starting Value. In contrast, a direct investment in an Underlying or in the securities included in one or

to receive Contingent Coupon Payments after the date of the Optional Early Redemption. If the Notes are called prior to the Maturity Date,

you may be unable to invest in other securities with a similar level of risk that could provide a return that is similar to the Notes.

Even if we do not exercise our option to call your Notes, our ability to do so may adversely affect the market value of your Notes. It

the Early Redemption Amount or the Redemption Amount, as applicable, by comparing only the Starting Value, the Coupon Barrier or the Threshold

into account. As a result, if the Notes are not called prior to maturity and the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less

In addition, our credit ratings and the credit ratings of the Guarantor are assessments by ratings agencies of our respective abilities

The prices of stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology are particularly vulnerable to rapid changes

in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally,

including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of technology companies and companies that rely heavily

on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Technology companies

are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability.

Additionally, companies in the technology sector may face dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for

the services of qualified personnel. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on the return on the Notes. Accordingly, by investing

in the Notes, you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment linked to companies that operate in

multiple sectors.</FONT></P>

as the net asset value per share or unit of the XLU, especially during periods of market volatility. </B>The performance of the XLU and

that of its underlying index generally will vary due to, for example, transaction costs, management fees, certain corporate actions, and

timing variances. Moreover, it is also possible that the performance of the XLU may not fully replicate or may, in certain circumstances,

diverge significantly from the performance of its underlying index. This could be due to, for example, the XLU not holding all or substantially

all of the underlying assets included in its underlying index and/or holding assets that are not included in its underlying index, the

temporary unavailability of certain securities in the secondary market, the performance of any derivative instruments held by the XLU,

differences in trading hours between the XLU (or the underlying assets held by the XLU) and its underlying index, or other circumstances.

This variation in performance is called the &ldquo;tracking error,&rdquo; and, at times, the tracking error may be significant. In addition,

because the shares or units of the XLU are traded on a securities exchange and are subject to market supply and investor demand, the market

price of one share or unit of the XLU may differ from its respective net asset value per share or unit; shares or units of the XLU may

trade at, above, or below its net asset value per share or unit. During periods of market volatility, securities held by the XLU may be

unavailable in the secondary market, market participants may be unable to calculate accurately the respective net asset value per share

or unit of the XLU and the liquidity of the XLU may be adversely affected. Market volatility may also disrupt the ability of market participants

to trade shares or units of the XLU. Further, market volatility may adversely affect, sometimes materially, the prices at which market

participants are willing to buy and sell shares or units of the XLU. As a result, under these circumstances, the market value of shares

or units of the XLU may vary substantially from the net asset value per share or unit of the XLU.</FONT></P>

index. </FONT>The NDXT is rebalanced quarterly such that all issuers within the NDXT have an equal index market value. The NDXT follows

the same reconstitution and rebalance schedule as the NDX. For issuers represented by multiple securities, the index market values are

equally apportioned across their respective index securities. Index shares are calculated by dividing each index security's resulting

index market value by its last sale price.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The value of the NDXT equals the NDXT market value divided

by the NDXT divisor. The overall NDXT market value is the aggregate of each NDXT stock&rsquo;s market value, adjusted by the NDXT stock&rsquo;s

equal-weighting factor used to assign an equal weight at the previous rebalancing, as may be adjusted for any corporate actions. A NDXT

stock&rsquo;s market value is determined by multiplying the last sale price by the number of shares of the index security included in

the NDX. In other words, the value of the NDXT is equal to (i) the sum of the products of (a) the index shares of each of the NDXT stocks

multiplied by (b) each such stock&rsquo;s last sale price (adjusted for corporate actions, if any) multiplied by (c) such stock&rsquo;s

equal weighting factor, divided by (ii) the divisor of the NDXT.</P>

Nasdaq exchange on a given day or the relevant Nasdaq exchange has not opened for trading, the previous index calculation day&rsquo;s

closing price for index security (adjusted for corporate actions occurring prior to market open on the current day, if any) is used. If

an index security is halted during the trading day, the most recent last sale price is used until trading resumes. For securities where

NASDAQ is the relevant Nasdaq exchange, the last sale price may be the Nasdaq Official Closing Price when it is closed.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0"><FONT STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">The

value of the NDX equals the aggregate value of the NDX share weights (the &ldquo;NDX Shares&rdquo;) of each of the NDX securities multiplied

by each such security&rsquo;s last sale price (last sale price refers to the last sale price on NASDAQ), and divided by the divisor of

the NDX. If trading in an NDX security is halted while the market is open, the last traded price for that security is used for all NDX

computations until trading resumes. If trading is halted before the market is open, the previous day&rsquo;s last sale price is used.

The formula for determining the NDX value is as follows:</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The NDX is ordinarily calculated without regard to cash

dividends on NDX securities. The NDX is calculated during the trading day and is disseminated once per second from 09:30:01 to 17:16:00

ET. The closing level of the NDX may change up until 17:15:00 ET due to corrections to the last sale price of the NDX securities. The

official closing value of the NDX is ordinarily disseminated at 17:16:00 ET.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">Changes to the NDX constituents may be made during the

annual ranking review. In addition, if at any time during the year other than the annual review, it is determined that an NDX security

issuer no longer meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the NDX, or is otherwise determined to have become ineligible for continued

inclusion in the NDX, it is replaced with the largest market capitalization issuer not currently in the NDX that meets the applicable

eligibility criteria for initial inclusion in the NDX.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">Ordinarily, a security will be removed from the NDX

at its last sale price. However, if at the time of its removal the NDX security is halted from trading on its primary listing market and

an official closing price cannot readily be determined, the NDX security may, in Nasdaq, Inc.&rsquo;s discretion, be removed at a price

of $0.00000001 (&ldquo;zero price&rdquo;). This zero price will be applied to the NDX security after the close of the market but prior

to the time the official closing value of the NDX is disseminated.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The divisor is adjusted to ensure that changes in the

NDX constituents either by corporate actions (that adjust either the price or shares of an NDX security) or NDX participation outside

of trading hours do not affect the value of the NDX. All divisor changes occur after the close of the applicable index security markets.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #404040; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0">The NDX will be rebalanced on a quarterly basis if it

is determined that (1) the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0% of the

NDX or (2) the collective weight of those securities whose individual current weights are in excess of 4.5% exceeds 48.0% of the NDX.

In addition, a &ldquo;special rebalancing&rdquo; of the NDX may be conducted at any time if Nasdaq, Inc. determines it necessary to maintain

the integrity and continuity of the NDX. If either one or both of the above weight distribution conditions are met upon quarterly review,

or Nasdaq, Inc. determines that a special rebalancing is necessary, a weight rebalancing will be performed.</P>

the current weight of the single NDX security with the largest market capitalization is greater than 24.0%, then the weights of all securities

with current weights greater than 1.0% (&ldquo;large securities&rdquo;) will be scaled down proportionately toward 1.0% until the adjusted

weight of the single largest NDX security reaches 20.0%.</P>

resulting from either or both of the rebalancing steps above will then be redistributed to those securities with weightings of less than

1.0% (&ldquo;small securities&rdquo;) in the following manner. In the first iteration, the weight of the largest small security will be

scaled upwards by a factor which sets it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities

will be scaled up by the same factor reduced in relation to each security&rsquo;s relative ranking among the small securities such that

the smaller the NDX security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. This is intended to reduce the market impact of

the weight rebalancing on the smallest component securities in the NDX.</P>

the weight of the second largest small security, already adjusted in the first iteration, will be scaled upwards by a factor which sets

it equal to the average NDX weight of 1.0%. The weights of each of the smaller remaining small securities will be scaled up by this same

factor reduced in relation to each security&rsquo;s relative ranking among the small securities such that, once again, the smaller the

security in the ranking, the less its weight will be scaled upward. Additional iterations will be performed until the accumulated increase

in weight among the small securities equals the aggregate weight reduction among the large securities that resulted from the rebalancing

to the NDX Shares will be made effective after the close of trading on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and an

adjustment to the divisor is made to ensure continuity of the NDX. Ordinarily, new rebalanced NDX Shares will be determined by applying

the above procedures to the current NDX Shares. However, Nasdaq, Inc. may, from time to time, determine rebalanced weights, if necessary,

by applying the above procedure to the actual current market capitalization of the NDX components. In such instances, Nasdaq, Inc. would

announce the different basis for rebalancing prior to its implementation.</P>

Otherwise, if the change in total shares outstanding is less than 10.0%, then all such changes are accumulated and made effective at one

time on a quarterly basis after the close of trading on the third Friday in each of March, June, September, and December. The NDX Shares

are derived from the security&rsquo;s total shares outstanding. The NDX Shares are adjusted by the same percentage amount by which the

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The RTY was developed by Russell Investments (&ldquo;Russell&rdquo;)

before FTSE International Limited and Russell combined in 2015 to create FTSE Russell, which is wholly owned by London Stock Exchange

Group. Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website

is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Russell began dissemination of the RTY on January

1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY

is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP>

Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Index. The Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP>

Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.

The RTY is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="font: 8pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0"><B><I>Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY</I></B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Each company eligible for inclusion in the RTY must

be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell&rsquo;s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated

headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible),

then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three

Home Country Indicators (&ldquo;HCIs&rdquo;): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange

(as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares

the primary location of the company&rsquo;s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs,

then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which

the company&rsquo;s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company&rsquo;s revenues are primarily

derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data

to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the

company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company&rsquo;s principal executive offices, unless

that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (&ldquo;BDI&rdquo;) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country

of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire,

British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey,

Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or

headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">All securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY

must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading

day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing

member&rsquo;s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing

prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each

quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion.

If an existing stock does not trade on the &ldquo;rank day&rdquo; (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is

announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible

for inclusion.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">An important criterion used to determine the list

of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in

May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common

stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any

other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants

and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist,

they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is

considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the

highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Companies with a total market capitalization of

less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their shares available in the marketplace

are not eligible for the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required

to report Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special

purpose acquisition companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter

traded securities are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Annual reconstitution is a process by which the

RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company&rsquo;s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May

of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies.

Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs

on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization

ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined,

a security&rsquo;s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as &ldquo;free

float.&rdquo; The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase

Fund</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The shares of the XLU are issued by Select Sector

SPDR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Trust, a registered investment company. The XLU seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and

yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU measures the performance of the utilities sector

of the U.S. equity market. The XLU is composed of equity securities of companies in the electric utilities, water utilities, multi-utilities,

independent power producers and energy traders, and gas utilities industries. The XLU trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol

&ldquo;XLU.&rdquo;</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><B><I>Investment Approach</I></B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The XLU utilizes a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; or &ldquo;indexing&rdquo;

investment approach in attempting to track the performance of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU will invest in substantially

all of the securities which comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU will normally invest at least 95% of its total assets

in common stocks that comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><B><I>Investment Objective and Strategy</I></B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The XLU seeks to provide investment results that

correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The investment

manager of the XLU uses a replication strategy to try to achieve the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective, which means that the XLU generally

invests in substantially all of the securities represented in the Utilities Select Sector Index in approximately the same proportions

as the Utilities Select Sector Index. Under normal market conditions, the XLU generally invests at least 95% of its total assets in the

securities comprising the Utilities Select Sector Index. In certain situations or market conditions, the XLU may temporarily depart from

its normal investment policies and strategies provided that the alternative is consistent with the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective and

is in the best interest of the XLU. For example, if the XLU is unable to invest directly in a component security or if a derivative investment

may provide higher liquidity than other types of investments, it may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure

to the Utilities Select Sector Index that it tracks. Consequently, under such circumstances, the XLU may invest in a different mix of

investments than it would under normal circumstances. The XLU will provide shareholders with at least 60 days&rsquo; notice prior to any

material change in its investment policies. The XLU is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance

of an unmanaged index of securities. This differs from an actively managed underlying, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark

index.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Notwithstanding the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective,

the return on your Notes will not reflect any dividends paid on shares of the XLU, on the securities purchased by the XLU or on the securities

that comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The underlying index of the XLU is part of the Select

Sector Indices. The Select Sector Indices are sub-indices of the S&amp;P 500<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Index (&ldquo;SPX&rdquo;). Each stock in

the SPX is allocated to at least one Select Sector Index, and the combined companies of the eleven Select Sector Indices represent all

of the companies in the SPX. The industry indices are sub-categories within each Select Sector Index and represent a specific industry

segment of the overall Select Sector Index. The eleven Select Sector Indices seek to represent the eleven SPX sectors. The index compilation

agent for these indices (the &ldquo;Index Compilation Agent&rdquo;) determines the composition of the Select Sector Indices based on S&amp;P&rsquo;s

sector classification methodology. (Sector designations are determined by the index sponsor using criteria it has selected or developed.

Index sponsors may use very different standards for determining sector designations. In addition, many companies operate in a number of

sectors, but are listed in only one sector and the basis on which that sector is selected may also differ. As a result, sector comparisons

between indices with different index sponsors may reflect differences in methodology as well as actual differences in the sector composition

of the indices.</P>

(2) With prices reflected on the rebalancing reference date, and membership, shares outstanding, additional weight factor (capping factor)

and investable weight factors (as described in the section &ldquo;Computation of the S&amp;P 500 Index<SUP>&reg;</SUP>&rdquo; below) as

companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price

movement. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of

500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during

the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Company additions to the SPX must have an unadjusted

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">SPDJI calculates the SPX by reference to the prices

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Historically, the market value of any component

stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component

stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula,

before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI&rsquo;s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not

change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company&rsquo;s weight in the SPX.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Under float adjustment, the share counts used in

calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company&rsquo;s outstanding shares. Float

adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In September 2012, all shareholdings representing

more than 5% of a stock&rsquo;s outstanding shares, other than holdings by &ldquo;block owners,&rdquo; were removed from the float for

purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally, these &ldquo;control holders&rdquo; will include officers and directors, private equity, venture

capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted

shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government

entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in

a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds

and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers

and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Treasury stock, stock options, restricted shares,

equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust

to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally

part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted

or non-traded class are treated as a control block.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">For each stock, an investable weight factor (&ldquo;IWF&rdquo;)

is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total

shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For

example, if a company&rsquo;s officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the

company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company&rsquo;s

officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI

would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company&rsquo;s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control.

As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX

prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent

company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the

S&amp;P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate

methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941

through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and

track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been

set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is

computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the &ldquo;index divisor.&rdquo; By itself, the index divisor is

an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the

SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index

maintenance.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Index Maintenance</I></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Index maintenance includes monitoring and completing

the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to

company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares

outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due

to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting

the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of

individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing

level.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Changes in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as

reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented

when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change.

All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options,

warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations)

are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than

5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to

five days prior.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If a change in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more causes a company&rsquo;s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the

share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.</P>

are not affiliated with us, at an agreed discount to the principal amount. Each of those broker-dealers may sell the Notes to one or more

additional broker-dealers. BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase

or repurchase the Notes at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may

forgo some or all of their selling concessions, fees or commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these

fee-based advisory accounts may be as low as $992.50 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes.</P>

initial estimated value of the Notes. Any price offered by BofAS for the Notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and

other considerations, including the performance of the Underlyings and the remaining term of the Notes. However, none of us, the Guarantor,

BofAS or any of our other affiliates is obligated to purchase your Notes at any price or at any time, and we cannot assure you that any

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The Notes are our debt securities, the return on

which is linked to the performance of the Underlyings. The related guarantee is BAC&rsquo;s obligation. As is the case for all of our

and BAC&rsquo;s respective debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC&rsquo;s

actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes result in increased operational,

funding and liability management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer

to in this pricing supplement as BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for

a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the

economic terms of the Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, typically results in the initial estimated

value of the Notes on the pricing date being less than their public offering price.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In order to meet our payment obligations on the

Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options

or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms

provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC&rsquo;s creditworthiness, interest

rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes

and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">BofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements

will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates&rsquo; profit earned from, these hedging

arrangements. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging

transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The following summary of the material U.S. federal

income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent

supersedes, the discussion under &ldquo;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&rdquo; in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive

of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;),

regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (&ldquo;Treasury&rdquo;) (including proposed and temporary regulations),

rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect

and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that

the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This

summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be

applicable to a particular holder.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Although the Notes are issued by us, they will be

treated as if they were issued by BAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly throughout this tax discussion, references to

&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; are generally to BAC unless the context requires otherwise.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">This summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders

and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the Notes upon original issuance and will hold the Notes

as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not

excluded from the discussion under &ldquo;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&rdquo; in the accompanying prospectus.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">You should consult your own tax advisor concerning

the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes, as well as any tax consequences arising

under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax

laws.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Although there is no statutory, judicial, or administrative

authority directly addressing the characterization of the Notes, we intend to treat the Notes for all tax purposes as contingent income-bearing

single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings and under the terms of the Notes, we and every investor in the Notes agree,

in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat the Notes in accordance with such characterization.

In the opinion of our counsel, Sidley Austin LLP, it is reasonable to treat the Notes as contingent income-bearing single financial contracts

with respect to the Underlyings. However, Sidley Austin LLP has advised us that it is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not

that this treatment will be upheld. This discussion assumes that the Notes constitute contingent income-bearing single financial contracts

with respect to the Underlyings for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes did not constitute contingent income-bearing single

financial contracts, the tax consequences described below would be materially different.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>This characterization of the Notes is not binding

on the IRS or the courts. No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or

any similar instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no ruling is being requested from the IRS with respect to their proper

characterization and treatment. Due to the absence of authorities on point, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences

of an investment in the Notes are not certain, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with the characterization

and tax treatment described in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of

the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative characterizations.</I></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Unless otherwise stated, the following discussion

is based on the characterization described above. The discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a

significant loss of principal on an investment in the Notes.</P>

of an Underlying or the issuer of any component stock included in an Underlying that is an index would be treated as a &ldquo;passive

foreign investment company&rdquo; (&ldquo;PFIC&rdquo;), within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or a United States real property

holding corporation, within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. If the issuer of an Underlying or the issuer of one or more stocks

included in an Underlying that is an index were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply

to a holder of the Notes. You should refer to information filed with the SEC by the issuer of an Underlying or the issuers of the component

stocks included in each Underlying that is an index and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if

the issuer of an Underlying or the issuer of any component stock included in an Underlying that is an index is or becomes a PFIC or is

or becomes a United States real property holding corporation.</P>

any Contingent Coupon Payment on the Notes is uncertain, we intend to take the position, and the following discussion assumes, that any

Contingent Coupon Payment constitutes taxable ordinary income to a U.S. Holder at the time received or accrued in accordance with the

U.S. Holder&rsquo;s regular method of accounting. By purchasing the Notes you agree, in the absence of an administrative determination

or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat any Contingent Coupon Payment as described in the preceding sentence.</P>

above) and the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s tax basis in the Notes. A U.S. Holder&rsquo;s tax basis in the Notes will equal the amount paid by

be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject

to limitations.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Possible Application of Section 1260 of the Code.

</I>Since one Underlying is the type of financial asset described under Section 1260 of the Code (including, among others, any equity

interest in pass-through entities such as exchange traded funds, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships,

and passive foreign investment companies, each a &ldquo;Section 1260 Financial Asset&rdquo;), while the matter is not entirely clear,

there may exist a risk that an investment in the Notes will be treated , in whole or in part, as a &ldquo;constructive ownership transaction&rdquo;

to which Section 1260 of the Code applies. If Section 1260 of the Code applies, all or a portion of any long-term capital gain recognized

by a U.S. Holder in respect of the Notes will be recharacterized as ordinary income (the &ldquo;Excess Gain&rdquo;). In addition, an interest

charge will also apply to any deemed underpayment of tax in respect of any Excess Gain to the extent such gain would have resulted in

gross income inclusion for the U.S. Holder in taxable years prior to the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement

(assuming such income accrued at a constant rate equal to the applicable federal rate as of the date of sale, exchange, redemption, or

settlement).</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If an investment in the Notes is treated as a constructive

ownership transaction, it is not clear to what extent any long-term capital gain of a U.S. Holder in respect of the Notes will be recharacterized

as ordinary income. It is possible, for example, that the amount of the Excess Gain (if any) that would be recharacterized as ordinary

income in respect of the Notes will equal the excess of (i) any long-term capital gain recognized by the U.S. Holder in respect of the

Notes and attributable to Section 1260 Financial Assets, over (ii) the &ldquo;net underlying long-term capital gain&rdquo; (as defined

in Section 1260 of the Code) such U.S. Holder would have had if such U.S. Holder had acquired an amount of the corresponding Section 1260

Financial Assets at fair market value on the original issue date for an amount equal to the portion of the issue price of the Notes attributable

to the corresponding Section 1260 Financial Assets and sold such amount of Section 1260 Financial Assets at maturity or upon sale, exchange

or redemption of the Notes at fair market value. Unless otherwise established by clear and convincing evidence, the net underlying long-term

capital gain is treated as zero and therefore it is possible that all long-term capital gain recognized by a U.S. Holder in respect of

the Notes will be recharacterized as ordinary income if Section 1260 of the Code applies to an investment in the Notes. U.S. Holders should

consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of Section 1260 of the Code to an investment in the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">As described below, the IRS, as indicated in Notice

2008-2 (the &ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), is considering whether Section 1260 of the Code generally applies or should apply to the Notes, including

in situations where the Underlyings are not the type of financial asset described under Section 1260 of the Code.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Alternative Tax Treatments. </I>Due to the absence

of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the Notes, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors

regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the Notes. In particular, the IRS could seek to subject the Notes

to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character

of income on the Notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required to accrue original issue discount

every year at a &ldquo;comparable yield&rdquo; determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s

prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In addition, it is possible that the Notes could

be treated as a unit consisting of a deposit and a put option written by the Note holder, in which case the timing and character of income

on the Notes would be affected significantly.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The Notice sought comments from the public on the

taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as &ldquo;prepaid forward contracts.&rdquo; This Notice addresses instruments such as

the Notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be

required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis, regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity. It is not possible

to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future guidance may affect the amount, timing

and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The IRS and Treasury are also considering additional

issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether foreign holders

of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain

&ldquo;constructive ownership transactions,&rdquo; generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of

these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In addition, proposed Treasury regulations require

the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the

regulations states that the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on

those contracts, and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence. While the proposed regulations do not

apply to prepaid forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the

case of prepaid forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent

payments on prepaid forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Because of the absence of authority regarding the

appropriate tax characterization of the Notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the Notes in a manner that

results in tax consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or

loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes should be treated as ordinary gain

or loss.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Because some Underlyings are indices that periodically

rebalance, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a series of contingent income-bearing single financial contracts, each of

which matures on the next rebalancing date. If the Notes were properly characterized in such a manner, a U.S. Holder would be treated

as disposing of the Notes on each rebalancing date in return for new Notes that mature on the next rebalancing date, and a U.S. Holder

would accordingly likely recognize capital gain or loss on each rebalancing date equal to the difference between the holder&rsquo;s tax

basis in the Notes (which would be adjusted to take into account any prior recognition of gain or loss) and the fair market value of the

Notes on such date.</P>



<P STYLE="font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><B>Non-U.S. Holders</B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Because the U.S. federal income tax treatment of

the Notes (including any Contingent Coupon Payment) is uncertain, we (or the applicable paying agent) will withhold U.S. federal income

tax at a 30% rate (or at a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of any Contingent Coupon Payment made

unless such payments are effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the U.S. (in which case,

to avoid withholding, the Non-U.S. Holder will be required to provide a Form W-8ECI). We (or the applicable paying agent) will not pay

any additional amounts in respect of such withholding. To claim benefits under an income tax treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder must obtain a taxpayer

identification number and certify as to its eligibility under the appropriate treaty&rsquo;s limitations on benefits article, if applicable.

In addition, special rules may apply to claims for treaty benefits made by Non-U.S. Holders that are entities rather than individuals.

The availability of a lower rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty will depend on whether such rate applies to the

characterization of the payments under U.S. federal income tax laws. A Non-U.S. Holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal

withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for

refund with the IRS.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Except as discussed below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally

will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax for amounts paid in respect of the Notes (not including, for the avoidance

of doubt, amounts representing any Contingent Coupon Payment which would be subject to the rules discussed in the previous paragraph)

upon the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their settlement at maturity, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable

certification requirements and that the payment is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or

business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their settlement at maturity may

be subject to U.S. federal income tax if that Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual and is present in the U.S. for 183 days

or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement and certain other conditions are satisfied.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If a Non-U.S. Holder of the Notes is engaged in

or upon sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain

tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder,

although exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such Contingent Coupon Payment

and gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the

heading &ldquo;&mdash;U.S. Holders,&rdquo; for a description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing

of the Notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30%

(or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively

connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject to certain adjustments.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">A &ldquo;dividend equivalent&rdquo; payment is treated

as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid

to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (&ldquo;ELIs&rdquo;)

that are &ldquo;specified ELIs&rdquo; may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an &ldquo;underlying

security,&rdquo; which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment

with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, IRS guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent

payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1, 2025. Based on our

determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments, Non-U.S. Holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent

payments, if any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income

tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Underlyings or the Notes, and following such occurrence the Notes could

be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. Holders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions

in respect of the Underlyings or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding

tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding,

we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect

to amounts so withheld.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">As discussed above, alternative characterizations

of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization, by reason of change or clarification

of the law, by regulation or otherwise, cause payments as to the Notes to become subject to withholding tax in addition to the withholding

tax described above, tax will be withheld at the applicable statutory rate. Prospective Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax

advisors regarding the tax consequences of such alternative characterizations.</P>

while the matter is not entirely clear, individual Non-U.S. Holders, and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals&rsquo;

gross estates for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual

has retained certain interests or powers), should note that, absent an applicable treaty benefit, a Note is likely to be treated as U.S.

situs property, subject to U.S. federal estate tax. These individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the

U.S. federal estate tax consequences of investing in a Note.</P>
