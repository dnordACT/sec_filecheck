<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Any payments on the Notes depend on the credit risk

of BofA Finance, as Issuer, and BAC, as Guarantor, and on the performance of the Underlyings. The economic terms of the Notes are based

on BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate, which is the rate it would pay to borrow funds through the issuance of market-linked notes, and

the economic terms of certain related hedging arrangements BAC&rsquo;s affiliates enter into. BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate is typically

lower than the rate it would pay when it issues conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. This difference in funding rate,

as well as the underwriting discount, if any, the referral fee and the hedging related charges described below (see &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo;

beginning on page PS-8), will reduce the economic terms of the Notes to you and the initial estimated value of the Notes. Due to these

factors, the public offering price you pay to purchase the Notes will be greater than the initial estimated value of the Notes as of the

pricing date.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The initial estimated value range of the Notes is

set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The final pricing supplement will set forth the initial estimated value of the

Notes as of the pricing date. For more information about the initial estimated value and the structuring of the Notes, see &ldquo;Risk

Factors&rdquo; beginning on page PS-8 and &ldquo;Structuring the Notes&rdquo; on page PS-24.</P>

risks, many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security. Your decision to purchase the Notes should be made only after

carefully considering the risks of an investment in the Notes, including those discussed below, with your advisors in light of your particular

circumstances. The Notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable about significant elements of the Notes

or financial matters in general. You should carefully review the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes in the &ldquo;Risk

Factors&rdquo; sections beginning on page PS-5 of the accompanying product supplement, page S-6 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

and page 7 of the accompanying prospectus, each as identified on page PS-28 below. </I></P>

a comparable investment directly in the securities held by or included in the Underlyings. There is no guarantee that the Notes will be

called or, if not called, redeemed at maturity for more than the principal amount, and it is possible that you will not receive any positive

return on the Notes.</FONT></P>

to be more greatly impacted by interest rates due to their relatively high debt ratios. Additionally, certain utility companies have experienced

full or partial deregulation in recent years, and are therefore subject to greater competition. These factors could affect the utilities

as the net asset value per share or unit of the XLU, especially during periods of market volatility. </B>The performance of the XLU and

that of its underlying index generally will vary due to, for example, transaction costs, management fees, certain corporate actions, and

timing variances. Moreover, it is also possible that the performance of the XLU may not fully replicate or may, in certain circumstances,

diverge significantly from the performance of its underlying index. This could be due to, for example, the XLU not holding all or substantially

all of the underlying assets included in its underlying index and/or holding assets that are not included in its underlying index, the

temporary unavailability of certain securities in the secondary market, the performance of any derivative instruments held by the XLU,

differences in trading hours between the XLU (or the underlying assets held by the XLU) and its underlying index, or other circumstances.

This variation in performance is called the &ldquo;tracking error,&rdquo; and, at times, the tracking error may be significant. In addition,

because the shares or units of the XLU are traded on a securities exchange and are subject to market supply and investor demand, the market

price of one share or unit of the XLU may differ from its net asset value per share or unit; shares or units of the XLU may trade at,

above, or below its net asset value per share or unit. During periods of market volatility, securities held by the XLU may be unavailable

in the secondary market, market participants may be unable to calculate accurately the net asset value per share or unit of the XLU and

the liquidity of the XLU may be adversely affected. Market volatility may also disrupt the ability of market participants to trade shares

or units of the XLU. Further, market volatility may adversely affect, sometimes materially, the prices at which market participants are

willing to buy and sell shares or units of the XLU. As a result, under these circumstances, the market value of shares or units of the

XLU may vary substantially from the net asset value per share or unit of the XLU.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The RTY was developed by Russell Investments (&ldquo;Russell&rdquo;)

before FTSE International Limited and Russell combined in 2015 to create FTSE Russell, which is wholly owned by London Stock Exchange

Group. Additional information on the RTY is available at the following website: http://www.ftserussell.com. No information on that website

is deemed to be included or incorporated by reference in this pricing supplement.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Russell began dissemination of the RTY on January

1, 1984. FTSE Russell calculates and publishes the RTY. The RTY was set to 135 as of the close of business on December 31, 1986. The RTY

is designed to track the performance of the small capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. As a subset of the Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP>

Index, the RTY consists of the smallest 2,000 companies included in the Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Index. The Russell 3000<SUP>&reg;</SUP>

Index measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, representing approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market.

The RTY is determined, comprised, and calculated by FTSE Russell without regard to the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="font: 8pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0"><B><I>Selection of Stocks Comprising the RTY</I></B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Each company eligible for inclusion in the RTY must

be classified as a U.S. company under FTSE Russell&rsquo;s country-assignment methodology. If a company is incorporated, has a stated

headquarters location, and trades in the same country (American Depositary Receipts and American Depositary Shares are not eligible),

then the company is assigned to its country of incorporation. If any of the three factors are not the same, FTSE Russell defines three

Home Country Indicators (&ldquo;HCIs&rdquo;): country of incorporation, country of headquarters, and country of the most liquid exchange

(as defined by a two-year average daily dollar trading volume) from all exchanges within a country. Using the HCIs, FTSE Russell compares

the primary location of the company&rsquo;s assets with the three HCIs. If the primary location of its assets matches any of the HCIs,

then the company is assigned to the primary location of its assets. If there is insufficient information to determine the country in which

the company&rsquo;s assets are primarily located, FTSE Russell will use the country from which the company&rsquo;s revenues are primarily

derived for the comparison with the three HCIs in a similar manner. FTSE Russell uses the average of two years of assets or revenues data

to reduce potential turnover. If conclusive country details cannot be derived from assets or revenues data, FTSE Russell will assign the

company to the country of its headquarters, which is defined as the address of the company&rsquo;s principal executive offices, unless

that country is a Benefit Driven Incorporation (&ldquo;BDI&rdquo;) country, in which case the company will be assigned to the country

of its most liquid stock exchange. BDI countries include: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bonaire,

British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cook Islands, Curacao, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey,

Liberia, Marshall Islands, Panama, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Caicos Islands. For any companies incorporated or

headquartered in a U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands, a U.S. HCI is assigned.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">All securities eligible for inclusion in the RTY

must trade on a major U.S. exchange. Stocks must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on their primary exchange on the last trading

day in May to be eligible for inclusion during annual reconstitution. However, in order to reduce unnecessary turnover, if an existing

member&rsquo;s closing price is less than $1.00 on the last day of May, it will be considered eligible if the average of the daily closing

prices (from its primary exchange) during the month of May is equal to or greater than $1.00. Initial public offerings are added each

quarter and must have a closing price at or above $1.00 on the last day of their eligibility period in order to qualify for index inclusion.

If an existing stock does not trade on the &ldquo;rank day&rdquo; (typically the last trading day in May but a confirmed timetable is

announced each spring) but does have a closing price at or above $1.00 on another eligible U.S. exchange, that stock will be eligible

for inclusion.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">An important criterion used to determine the list

of securities eligible for the RTY is total market capitalization, which is defined as the market price as of the last trading day in

May for those securities being considered at annual reconstitution times the total number of shares outstanding. Where applicable, common

stock, non-restricted exchangeable shares and partnership units/membership interests are used to determine market capitalization. Any

other form of shares such as preferred stock, convertible preferred stock, redeemable shares, participating preferred stock, warrants

and rights, installment receipts or trust receipts, are excluded from the calculation. If multiple share classes of common stock exist,

they are combined. In cases where the common stock share classes act independently of each other (e.g., tracking stocks), each class is

considered for inclusion separately. If multiple share classes exist, the pricing vehicle will be designated as the share class with the

highest two-year trading volume as of the rank day in May.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Companies with a total market capitalization of

less than $30 million are not eligible for the RTY. Similarly, companies with only 5% or less of their</P>

for the RTY. Royalty trusts, limited liability companies, closed-end investment companies (companies that are required to report Acquired

Fund Fees and Expenses, as defined by the SEC, including business development companies), blank check companies, special purpose acquisition

companies, and limited partnerships are also ineligible for inclusion. Bulletin board, pink sheets, and over-the-counter traded securities

are not eligible for inclusion. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are also excluded.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Annual reconstitution is a process by which the

RTY is completely rebuilt. Based on closing levels of the company&rsquo;s common stock on its primary exchange on the rank day of May

of each year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes the composition of the RTY using the then existing market capitalizations of eligible companies.

Reconstitution of the RTY occurs on the last Friday in June or, when the last Friday in June is the 29th or 30th, reconstitution occurs

on the prior Friday. In addition, FTSE Russell adds initial public offerings to the RTY on a quarterly basis based on total market capitalization

ranking within the market-adjusted capitalization breaks established during the most recent reconstitution. After membership is determined,

a security&rsquo;s shares are adjusted to include only those shares available to the public. This is often referred to as &ldquo;free

float.&rdquo; The purpose of the adjustment is to exclude from market calculations the capitalization that is not available for purchase

and is not part of the investable opportunity set.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #E31837; font: bold 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 10pt 0">The S&amp;P 500&reg; Index</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The SPX includes a representative sample of 500

companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price

movement. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of

500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during

the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The SPX includes companies from eleven main groups:

Communication Services; Consumer Discretionary; Consumer Staples; Energy; Financials; Health Care; Industrials; Information Technology;

Real Estate; Materials; and Utilities. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (&ldquo;SPDJI&rdquo;), the sponsor of the SPX, may from time to time,

in its sole discretion, add companies to, or delete companies from, the SPX to achieve the objectives stated above.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Company additions to the SPX must have an unadjusted

company market capitalization of $15.8 billion or more (an increase from the previous requirement of an unadjusted company market capitalization

of $14.5 billion or more).</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">SPDJI calculates the SPX by reference to the prices

of the constituent stocks of the SPX without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result, the return on

the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid

on those stocks.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Computation of the SPX</I></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">While SPDJI currently employs the following methodology

to calculate the SPX, no assurance can be given that SPDJI will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect payments

on the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Historically, the market value of any component

stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component

stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula,

before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI&rsquo;s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not

change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company&rsquo;s weight in the SPX.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Under float adjustment, the share counts used in

calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company&rsquo;s outstanding shares. Float

adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In September 2012, all shareholdings representing

more than 5% of a stock&rsquo;s outstanding shares, other than holdings by &ldquo;block owners,&rdquo; were removed from the float for

purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally, these &ldquo;control holders&rdquo; will include officers and directors, private equity, venture

capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted

shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government

entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in

a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds

and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers

and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Treasury stock, stock options, restricted shares,

equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust

to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally

part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted

or non-traded class are treated as a control block.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">For each stock, an investable weight factor (&ldquo;IWF&rdquo;)

is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total

shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For

example, if a company&rsquo;s officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the

company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company&rsquo;s

officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI

would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company&rsquo;s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control.

As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX

prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent

company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the

S&amp;P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate

methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941

through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and

track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been

set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is

computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the &ldquo;index divisor.&rdquo; By itself, the index divisor is

an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the

SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index

maintenance.</P>

the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to

company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares

outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due

to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting

the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of

individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing

level.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Changes in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as

reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented

when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change.

All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options,

warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations)

are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than

5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to

five days prior.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If a change in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more causes a company&rsquo;s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the

share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The shares of the XLU are issued by Select Sector

SPDR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Trust, a registered investment company. The XLU seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and

yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU measures the performance of the utilities sector

of the U.S. equity market. The XLU is composed of equity securities of companies in the electric utilities, water utilities, multi-utilities,

independent power producers and energy traders, and gas utilities industries. The XLU trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol

&ldquo;XLU.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The XLU utilizes a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; or &ldquo;indexing&rdquo;

investment approach in attempting to track the performance of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU will invest in substantially

all of the securities which comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index. The XLU will normally invest at least 95% of its total assets

in common stocks that comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><B><I>Investment Objective and Strategy</I></B></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The XLU seeks to provide investment results that

correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Utilities Select Sector Index. The investment

manager of the XLU uses a replication strategy to try to achieve the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective, which means that the XLU generally

invests in substantially all of the securities represented in the Utilities Select Sector Index in approximately the same proportions

as the Utilities Select Sector Index. Under normal market conditions, the XLU generally invests at least 95% of its total assets in the

securities comprising the Utilities Select Sector Index. In certain situations or market conditions, the XLU may temporarily depart from

its normal investment policies and strategies provided that the alternative is consistent with the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective and

is in the best interest of the XLU. For example, if the XLU is unable to invest directly in a component security or if a derivative investment

may provide higher liquidity than other types of investments, it may make larger than normal investments in derivatives to maintain exposure

to the Utilities Select Sector Index that it tracks. Consequently, under such circumstances, the XLU may invest in a different mix of

investments than it would under normal circumstances. The XLU will provide shareholders with at least 60 days notice prior to any material

change in its investment policies. The XLU is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged

index of securities. This differs from an actively managed underlying, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Notwithstanding the XLU&rsquo;s investment objective,

the return on your Notes will not reflect any dividends paid on shares of the XLU, on the securities purchased by the XLU or on the securities

that comprise the Utilities Select Sector Index.</P>

Sector Indices. The Select Sector Indices are sub-indices of the S&amp;P 500<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Index (&ldquo;SPX&rdquo;). Each stock in

the SPX is allocated to at least one Select Sector Index, and the combined companies of the eleven Select Sector Indices represent all

of the companies in the SPX. The industry indices are sub-categories within each Select Sector Index and represent a specific industry

segment of the overall Select Sector Index. The eleven Select Sector Indices seek to represent the eleven SPX sectors. The index compilation

agent for these indices (the &ldquo;Index Compilation Agent&rdquo;) determines the composition of the Select Sector Indices based on S&amp;P&rsquo;s

sector classification methodology. (Sector designations are determined by the index sponsor using criteria it has selected or developed.

Index sponsors may use very different standards for determining sector designations. In addition, many companies operate in a number of

sectors, but are listed in only one sector and the basis on which that sector is selected may also differ. As a result, sector comparisons

between indices with different index sponsors may reflect differences in methodology as well as actual differences in the sector composition

of the indices.</P>

companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of common stock price

movement. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of

500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during

the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.</P>

Real Estate; Materials; and Utilities. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (&ldquo;SPDJI&rdquo;), the sponsor of the SPX, may from time to time,

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">SPDJI calculates the SPX by reference to the prices

the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Historically, the market value of any component

stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component

stock. In March 2005, SPDJI began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula,

before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16, 2005. SPDJI&rsquo;s criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not

change with the shift to float adjustment. However, the adjustment affects each company&rsquo;s weight in the SPX.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Under float adjustment, the share counts used in

calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors, not all of a company&rsquo;s outstanding shares. Float

adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups, other publicly traded companies or government agencies.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In September 2012, all shareholdings representing

more than 5% of a stock&rsquo;s outstanding shares, other than holdings by &ldquo;block owners,&rdquo; were removed from the float for

purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally, these &ldquo;control holders&rdquo; will include officers and directors, private equity, venture

capital and special equity firms, other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control, strategic partners, holders of restricted

shares, ESOPs, employee and family trusts, foundations associated with the company, holders of unlisted share classes of stock, government

entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in

a company as reported in regulatory filings. However, holdings by block owners, such as depositary banks, pension funds, mutual funds

and ETF providers, 401(k) plans of the company, government retirement/pension funds, investment funds of insurance companies, asset managers

and investment funds, independent foundations and savings and investment plans, will ordinarily be considered part of the float.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Treasury stock, stock options, restricted shares,

equity participation units, warrants, preferred stock, convertible stock, and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust

to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile, such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares, are normally

part of the float unless those shares form a control block. If a company has multiple classes of stock outstanding, shares in an unlisted

or non-traded class are treated as a control block.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">For each stock, an investable weight factor (&ldquo;IWF&rdquo;)

is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total

shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. This calculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For

example, if a company&rsquo;s officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares, and no other control group holds 5% of the

company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI would assign that company an IWF of 1.00, as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However, if a company&rsquo;s

officers and directors hold 3% of the company&rsquo;s shares and another control group holds 20% of the company&rsquo;s shares, SPDJI

would assign an IWF of 0.77, reflecting the fact that 23% of the company&rsquo;s outstanding shares are considered to be held for control.

As of July 31, 2017, companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX

prior to July 31, 2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent

company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure, that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the

S&amp;P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate

methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941

through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to work with and

track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been

set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941- 43 = 10. In practice, the daily calculation of the SPX is

computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the &ldquo;index divisor.&rdquo; By itself, the index divisor is

an arbitrary number. However, in the context of the calculation of the SPX, it serves as a link to the original base period level of the

SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX, which is index

maintenance.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Index Maintenance</I></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Index maintenance includes monitoring and completing

the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to

company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, require changes in the common shares

outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX, and do not require index divisor adjustments.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due

to corporate actions, corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting

the index divisor for the change in market value, the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of

individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing

level.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Changes in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more due to mergers, acquisitions, public offerings, tender offers, Dutch auctions, or exchange offers are made as soon as

reasonably possible. Share changes due to mergers or acquisitions of publicly held companies that trade on a major exchange are implemented

when the transaction occurs, even if both of the companies are not in the same headline index, and regardless of the size of the change.

All other changes of 5.00% or more (due to, for example, company stock repurchases, private placements, redemptions, exercise of options,

warrants, conversion of preferred stock, notes, debt, equity participation units, at-the-market offerings, or other recapitalizations)

are made weekly and are announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading on the following Friday. Changes of less than

5.00% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, and are usually announced two to

five days prior.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If a change in a company&rsquo;s shares outstanding

of 5.00% or more causes a company&rsquo;s IWF to change by five percentage points or more, the IWF is updated at the same time as the

share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case by case basis.</P>

in New York, New York on a date that is greater than two business days following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any

such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the initial settlement of the Notes occurs more than two business days from the

are not affiliated with us, at an agreed discount to the principal amount. Each of those broker-dealers may sell the Notes to one or more

additional broker-dealers. BofAS has informed us that these discounts may vary from dealer to dealer and that not all dealers will purchase

or repurchase the Notes at the same discount. Certain dealers who purchase the Notes for sale to certain fee-based advisory accounts may

forgo some or all of their selling concessions, fees or commissions. The public offering price for investors purchasing the Notes in these

fee-based advisory accounts may be as low as $999.00 per $1,000.00 in principal amount of Notes. In addition to the underwriting discount,

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The Notes are our debt securities, the return on

which is linked to the performance of the Underlyings. The related guarantee is BAC&rsquo;s obligation. As is the case for all of our

and BAC&rsquo;s respective debt securities, including our market-linked notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our and BAC&rsquo;s

actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because market-linked notes result in increased operational,

funding and liability management costs to us and BAC, BAC typically borrows the funds under these types of notes at a rate, which we refer

to in this pricing supplement as BAC&rsquo;s internal funding rate, that is more favorable to BAC than the rate that it might pay for

a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security. This generally relatively lower internal funding rate, which is reflected in the

economic terms of the Notes, along with the fees and charges associated with market-linked notes, typically results in the initial estimated

value of the Notes on the pricing date being less than their public offering price.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In order to meet our payment obligations on the

Notes, at the time we issue the Notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options, put options

or other derivatives) with BofAS or one of our other affiliates. The terms of these hedging arrangements are determined based upon terms

provided by BofAS and its affiliates, and take into account a number of factors, including our and BAC&rsquo;s creditworthiness, interest

rate movements, the volatility of the Underlyings, the tenor of the Notes and the hedging arrangements. The economic terms of the Notes

and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">BofAS has advised us that the hedging arrangements

will include hedging related charges, reflecting the costs associated with, and our affiliates&rsquo; profit earned from, these hedging

arrangements. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, actual profits or losses from these hedging

transactions may be more or less than any expected amounts.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The following summary of the material U.S. federal

income and estate tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes supplements, and to the extent inconsistent

supersedes, the discussion under &ldquo;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&rdquo; in the accompanying prospectus and is not exhaustive

of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;),

regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (&ldquo;Treasury&rdquo;) (including proposed and temporary regulations),

rulings, current administrative interpretations and official pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect

and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that

the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This

summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be

applicable to a particular holder.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Although the Notes are issued by us, they will be

treated as if they were issued by BAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly throughout this tax discussion, references to

&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo; are generally to BAC unless the context requires otherwise.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">This summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders

and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the Notes upon original issuance and will hold the Notes

as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not

excluded from the discussion under &ldquo;U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&rdquo; in the accompanying prospectus.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">You should consult your own tax advisor concerning

the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes, as well as any tax consequences arising

under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax

laws.</P>

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Although there is no statutory, judicial, or administrative

authority directly addressing the characterization of the Notes, in the opinion of our counsel, Sidley Austin LLP, and based on certain

factual representations received from us, the Notes should be treated as single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings and

under the terms of the Notes, we and every investor in the Notes agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial

ruling to the contrary, to treat the Notes in accordance with such characterization. This discussion assumes that the Notes constitute

single financial contracts with respect to the Underlyings for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes did not constitute single

financial contracts, the tax consequences described below would be materially different.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>This characterization of the Notes is not binding

on the IRS or the courts. No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the Notes or

any similar instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no ruling is being requested from the IRS with respect to their proper

characterization and treatment. Due to the absence of authorities on point, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences

of an investment in the Notes are not certain, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with the characterization

and tax treatment described in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of

the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative characterizations.</I></P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Unless otherwise stated, the following discussion

is based on the characterization described above. The discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a

significant loss of principal on an investment in the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">We will not attempt to ascertain whether the issuer

of an Underlying or the issuer of any component stock included in an Underlying that is an index would be treated as a &ldquo;passive

foreign investment company&rdquo; (&ldquo;PFIC&rdquo;), within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, or a United States real property

holding corporation, within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. If the issuer of an Underlying or the issuer of one or more stocks

included in an Underlying that is an index were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply

to a holder of the Notes. You should refer to information filed with the SEC by the issuer of an Underlying or the issuers of the component

stocks included in each Underlying that is an index and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if

the issuer of an Underlying or the issuer of any component stock included in an Underlying that is an index is or becomes a PFIC or is

or becomes a United States real property holding corporation.</P>

a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the

difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s tax basis in the Notes. A U.S. Holder&rsquo;s tax basis in the Notes

will equal the amount paid by that holder to acquire them. Subject to the discussion below concerning the possible application of the

&ldquo;constructive ownership&rdquo; rules of Section 1260 of the Code, this capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital

gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the Notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.</P>

and passive foreign investment companies, each a &ldquo;Section 1260 Financial Asset&rdquo;), while the matter is not entirely clear,

there may exist a risk that an investment in the Notes will be treated , in whole or in part, as a &ldquo;constructive ownership transaction&rdquo;

<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Notes will be recharacterized as ordinary income

(the &ldquo;Excess Gain&rdquo;). In addition, an interest charge will also apply to any deemed underpayment of tax in respect of any Excess

Gain to the extent such gain would have resulted in gross income inclusion for the U.S. Holder in taxable years prior to the taxable year

of the sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement (assuming such income accrued at a constant rate equal to the applicable federal rate

as of the date of sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement).</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If an investment in the Notes is treated as a constructive

ownership transaction, it is not clear to what extent any long-term capital gain of a U.S. Holder in respect of the Notes will be recharacterized

as ordinary income. It is possible, for example, that the amount of the Excess Gain (if any) that would be recharacterized as ordinary

income in respect of the Notes will equal the excess of (i) any long-term capital gain recognized by the U.S. Holder in respect of the

Notes and attributable to Section 1260 Financial Assets, over (ii) the &ldquo;net underlying long-term capital gain&rdquo; (as defined

in Section 1260 of the Code) such U.S. Holder would have had if such U.S. Holder had acquired an amount of the corresponding Section 1260

Financial Assets at fair market value on the original issue date for an amount equal to the portion of the issue price of the Notes attributable

to the corresponding Section 1260 Financial Assets and sold such amount of Section 1260 Financial Assets at maturity or upon sale, exchange

or redemption of the Notes at fair market value. Unless otherwise established by clear and convincing evidence, the net underlying long-term

capital gain is treated as zero and therefore it is possible that all long-term capital gain recognized by a U.S. Holder in respect of

the Notes will be recharacterized as ordinary income if Section 1260 of the Code applies to an investment in the Notes. U.S. Holders should

consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of Section 1260 of the Code to an investment in the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">As described below, the IRS, as indicated in Notice

2008-2 (the &ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), is considering whether Section 1260 of the Code generally applies or should apply to the Notes, including

in situations where the Underlyings are not the type of financial asset described under Section 1260 of the Code.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0"><I>Alternative Tax Treatments. </I>Due to the absence

of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the Notes, prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors

regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the Notes. In particular, the IRS could seek to subject the Notes

to the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character

of income on the Notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required to accrue original issue discount

every year at a &ldquo;comparable yield&rdquo; determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized at

maturity or upon a sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes generally would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s

prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The Notice sought comments from the public on the

taxation of financial instruments currently taxed as &ldquo;prepaid forward contracts.&rdquo; This Notice addresses instruments such as

the Notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be

required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis, regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity. It is not possible

to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future guidance may affect the amount, timing

and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">The IRS and Treasury are also considering additional

issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether foreign holders

of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain

&ldquo;constructive ownership transactions,&rdquo; generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of

these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">In addition, proposed Treasury regulations require

the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the

regulations states that the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on

those contracts, and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence. While the proposed regulations do not

apply to prepaid forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the

case of prepaid forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic accrual for contingent

payments on prepaid forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the Notes.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Because of the absence of authority regarding the

appropriate tax characterization of the Notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the Notes in a manner that

results in tax consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or

loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes should be treated as ordinary gain

or loss.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">Because some Underlyings are indices that periodically

rebalance, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as a series of single financial contracts, each of which matures on the next

rebalancing date. If the Notes were properly characterized in such a manner, a U.S. Holder would be treated as disposing of the Notes

on each rebalancing date in return for new Notes that mature on the next rebalancing date, and a U.S. Holder would accordingly likely

recognize capital gain or loss on each rebalancing date equal to the difference between the holder&rsquo;s tax basis in the Notes (which

would be adjusted to take into account any prior recognition of gain or loss) and the fair market value of the Notes on such date.</P>

business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange, or redemption of the Notes or their settlement at maturity may

be subject to U.S. federal income tax if that Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual and is present in the U.S. for 183 days

or more during the taxable year of the sale, exchange, redemption, or settlement and certain other conditions are satisfied.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">If a Non-U.S. Holder of the Notes is engaged in

the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. and if any gain realized on the settlement at maturity, or upon sale, exchange, or

redemption of the Notes, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable

to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding

tax, generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder.

Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading &ldquo;&mdash;U.S. Holders,&rdquo; for a description of the U.S. federal

income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the Notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation,

it may also be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of

its earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject

to certain adjustments.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">A &ldquo;dividend equivalent&rdquo; payment is treated

as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid

to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (&ldquo;ELIs&rdquo;)

that are &ldquo;specified ELIs&rdquo; may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an &ldquo;underlying

security,&rdquo; which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment

with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However, IRS guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent

payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1, 2025. Based on our

determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments, Non-U.S. Holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent

payments, if any, under the Notes. However, it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income

tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Underlyings or the Notes, and following such occurrence the Notes could

be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. Holders that enter, or have entered, into other transactions

in respect of the Underlyings or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding

tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding,

we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect

to amounts so withheld.</P>



<P STYLE="color: #59595B; font: 8pt/11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 8pt 0">As discussed above, alternative characterizations

of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization, by reason of change or clarification

of the law, by regulation or otherwise, cause payments as to the Notes to become subject to withholding tax, tax will be withheld at the

applicable statutory rate. As discussed above, the IRS has indicated in the Notice that it is considering whether income in respect of

instruments such as the Notes should be subject to withholding tax. Prospective Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors

regarding the tax consequences of such alternative characterizations.</P>

while the matter is not entirely clear, individual Non-U.S. Holders, and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals&rsquo;

gross estates for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual

has retained certain interests or powers), should note that, absent an applicable treaty benefit, a Note is likely to be treated as U.S.
